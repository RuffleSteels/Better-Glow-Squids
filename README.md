# Better Glow Squids [![RuffleSteels](https://img.shields.io/badge/Me-RuffleSteels-green)](https://github.com/RuffleSteels/Better-Glow-Squids/blob/master/README.md)
> #### Adds more uses to the newly added 'Glow Squids'


This mod adds better functions to the 'Glow Squids' such as glowing potions! When you splash a regular squid with a glowing potion, it turns into a glow squid!
